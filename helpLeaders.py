        In this if and the next one, what I do is to make a kind of pop (save the head and then remove it)
        so it won't repeat again in the next loops, because each loop makes all the possible permutations
        for that head, so is not necessary that ir remains in the list. More over, each loops iterates over
        a list that, of course, does not include the head: We have a list of 8 elementes (1-8), the 
        firstWord variables save the element [1], then the code remove it from the list (list = 2-8) and will
        start iterating over it; when the loop ends, we do the same with the remaining list: we take its head
        in firstWord=2 and when we remove the element from the list, it looks like list=3-8 and repeat the 
        process. This mechanism assures that there will not be repetitions of any kind.

        THE BACKTRACKING MECHANISM: Having the list of banned s-tuples, when the code creates a new s-tuple, 
        it compares it with all the elements of the banned list with the 'not in' command, if the s-tuple does not
        appears in 'banned' the it will be concatenated to the 'used' list and then the combination that makes the 
        s-tuple posible will be removed; on the contrary, if it finds that the s-tuple appears in the banned list, 
        it would not be stored and the combination that makes the s-tuple posible will be removed.
